# RichPublisherAppsTemplate
This repository is created to help Salesforce developers to build Rich Publisher Apps. This repository contains templates of composition and rendering components that can be modified and used to build a new Rich Publisher App.

You can refer to the [Rich Publisher Apps documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_meta.meta/api_meta/components_integrate_customapps_to_publisher.htm) to know more about what they are and how to use them in Chatter.
